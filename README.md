# 100+ Resources to become a great engineering leader

[The blog post](https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/100-resources-to-become-a-great-engineering)

**List of books, newsletters, people and more!**

Investing in yourself is a great investment anytime! I am sharing with you my personally curated resources to level up and grow to become a great engineering leader in 2024! 

Topics span from software engineering, system design, data engineering, leadership, management and all the way to product and business.

## How to start?

There are a LOT of resources here and your time is very important. I don‚Äôt suggest to go and try to study all of the resources at once, I suggest to pick a few resources at a time from specific categories that you need the most. That‚Äôs what I do as well.

When I need to go more in details in a specific category, I choose the resources and do a deep dive on the specific topics. I also connect with certain individuals, check their posts and / or ask them questions.

Important: Before you choose which resources you wish to go more in detail, I suggest to do a retrospective of your current skillset and define where you need to improve. This will ensure you are spending your time on the most impactful things first!
